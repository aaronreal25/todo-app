Code Review Questions

1. State Management
Q: Why did you choose the specific state management approach? How would you scale it for a larger application?

A: The Context API was chosen for this task management application because:
- The application has a relatively simple state structure that doesn't require complex state management
- Context provides a clean way to avoid prop drilling without adding external dependencies
- The application's size and complexity don't warrant the overhead of Redux or other complex state management solutions
- It's easy to test and mock in unit tests
- Built into React, reducing bundle size and complexity

For scaling to a larger application, I would:
- Split the context into smaller, more focused contexts (e.g., separate contexts for tasks, user preferences, etc.)
- Implement caching strategies for better performance with larger datasets
- Add a middleware pattern for handling side effects
- Consider switching to more robust solutions like Redux or Zustand if the application grows significantly
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

2. Performance Optimization
Q: What techniques did you use to optimize the performance of the application? How do they work?

A: Several performance optimization techniques were implemented:

1. React.memo for Components:
   - Used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components when their props haven't changed
   - Applied to TaskItem and TaskList components

2. Virtualization with react-window:
   - Implemented to efficiently handle large lists of tasks
   - Only renders tasks that are currently visible in the viewport
   - Significantly reduces DOM nodes and improves performance with large datasets

3. useMemo for Expensive Computations:
   - Used for task filtering operations to prevent unnecessary recalculations
   - Caches the filtered results until dependencies change

4. useCallback for Event Handlers:
   - Prevents recreation of function references on each render
   - Helps prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components

5. Proper Key Usage:
   - Implemented unique keys for list items to optimize React's reconciliation process

3. Testing Strategy
Q: How do you decide which parts of the application need to be unit tested? What are your guidelines?

A: My testing strategy follows these guidelines:

1. Core Functionality:
   - Test all critical user interactions (adding, editing, deleting tasks)
   - Verify state changes work correctly
   - Ensure filtering and search functionality works as expected

2. Edge Cases:
   - Test boundary conditions (empty lists, invalid inputs)
   - Verify error handling
   - Test overdue task highlighting
   - Test filter combinations

3. Component Testing:
   - Test component rendering
   - Verify prop changes are handled correctly
   - Test component interactions
   - Include snapshot tests for UI consistency

4. Integration Points:
   - Test context integration
   - Verify component communication
   - Test form submissions

5. Coverage Guidelines:
   - Aim for high coverage of business logic
   - Focus on user-facing functionality
   - Test error states and recovery
   - Include accessibility testing

4. Code Structure
Q: Explain how you organized your project structure and why.

A: The project structure follows these principles:

1. Component Organization:
   - Each component has its own directory
   - Components include the main component file, test file, and any related utilities
   - Shared components are separated from feature-specific components

2. Context Organization:
   - TaskContext handles global state management
   - Keeps state logic separate from UI components
   - Provides clear interfaces for state updates

3. Type Definitions:
   - Centralized types directory for shared interfaces
   - Ensures type consistency across the application
   - Makes it easy to maintain and update shared types

4. Test Organization:
   - Tests are co-located with their components
   - Clear naming conventions for test files
   - Separate test utilities when needed

5. File Structure:
   /src
   ├── app/                 # Next.js app directory
   ├── components/          # React components
   ├── context/            # Context API related files
   ├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
   └── __tests__/         # Test files

This organization provides:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy navigation
- Scalability for future features
- Maintainable codebase
- Logical grouping of related files
